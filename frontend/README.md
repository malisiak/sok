# sources

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.12.1.

## First steps
Reference [here](http://www.sitepoint.com/kickstart-your-angularjs-development-with-yeoman-grunt-and-bower/)

1. install node
2. install ruby and compass (`gem install compass`)
3. (suggested) `npm install -g yo grunt-cli bower generator-angular` 
4. run npm install to get all dependencies locally

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

Adding new elements to the project through yeoman, e.g. `yo angular:controller Awesome` creates AwesomeCtrl and required files.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma. (TBD)
